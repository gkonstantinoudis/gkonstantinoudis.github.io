      <description>I have just uploaded two more NIMBLE tutorials showing how to fit the Leroux model and how to code cubic splines and random walks of order 1 and 2 in NIMBLE. The tutorial are in the teaching tab under the names Leroux model in NIMBLE and CARBayes and Splines and random walk processes in NIMBLE. The are more to come.</description>

      <description>Our recent study in assessing the effect of long term exposure to airpollution on COVID-19 morality have just been published in Environment International, you can check it here. We found some evidence of an increased COVID-19 mortality for long term exposure to NO\(_2\) (0.5% 95% CrI: -0.2% to 1.2%), whereas for PM\(_{2.5}\) the results are more uncertain (1.4% 95% CrI: -2.1% to 5.1%).

      <description>I have been invited to give a talk at the TIES 2020 virtual conference. My talk will be about the use of Bayesian spatial hierarchical models and downscaling. I will use the proposed scheme to quantify the long-term effect of air-pollution on COVID-19 mortality. My talk will be on the 2nd of December at 10.50am UK time. For more information about the program see here.</description>

      <description>I have just uploaded my slides) for the invited talk in GEOMED Irvine California 2022. I was giving a talk about a modelling framework I develop, together with some collegues in Swtizerland to dissentagle direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on all-cause mortality.</description>
