I have been invited to give a talk at the [TIES 2020 virtual conference](http://www.environmetrics.org/virtual_conference_2020.html). My talk will be about the use of Bayesian spatial hierarchical models and downscaling. I will use the proposed scheme to quantify the long-term effect of air-pollution on COVID-19 mortality. My talk will be on the 2nd of December at 10.50am UK time. For more information about the program see [here](http://environmetrics.org/vc2020_program.html).
