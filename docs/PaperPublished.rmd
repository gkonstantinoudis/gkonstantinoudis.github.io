Our recent study in assessing the effect of long term exposure to airpollution on COVID-19 morality have just been published in Environment International, you can check it [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020322716). We found some evidence of an increased COVID-19 mortality for long term exposure to NO$_2$ (0.5% 95% CrI: -0.2% to 1.2%), whereas for PM$_{2.5}$ the results are more uncertain (1.4% 95% CrI: -2.1% to 5.1%).
