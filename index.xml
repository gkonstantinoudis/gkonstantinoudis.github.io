      <description>I am an MRC Skills Development Research Fellow at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, part of the MRC Centre for Environment and Health at Imperial College London. My group is the Environmental and Health Statistics group headed by Prof Marta Blangiardo.
Prior to that, I did my PhD in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) at the University of Bern in Switzerland in the Environmental and Spatial Epidemiology group headed by Dr Ben Spycher.</description>

      <description>COVID-19 and air-pollution In this research, I am developping spatial Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the effect of long term exposure to air-pollution, namely NO\(_2\) and PM\(_{2.5}\) on COVID-19 mortality. The first analysis showed that for every 1\(\mu g/m^3\) increase in the long term averaged NO\(_2\) exposure the COVID-19 mortality increases by 0.5% (95% credible interval: -0.2%, 1.2%), whereas the results for PM\(_{2.5}\) are more uncertain 1.4% (-2.1%, 5.</description>

      <description>I have written the following R-package:
GeoSwiss Tools for geocoding address in Switzerland. The package takes addresses as strings and uses two different data bases, google maps and Swiss topo (Swiss Federal Office of Topography) Switzerland&amp;rsquo;s national mapping agency and return the corresponding geocodes. The geocodes are directly transformed into the Swiss grid for coordinates and also come with a precision metric that gives a qualitative assessment of the precision of the geocode.</description>

      <description>NIMBLE tutorials All the code and datasets used for the tutorial can be also found here.
 Conditional Autoregressive models with NIMBLE.  In this tutorial I use the famours Scottish lip cancer dataset and provide 4 different approaches for disease mapping. I start with a basic global smoothing by incorporating unstructured random effect, then I show how to fit an ICAR, I continue showwing a BYM model and finally I show how to fit the BYM2 in NIMBLE.</description>

      <description>Our recent study in assessing the effect of long term exposure to airpollution on COVID-19 morality have just been published in Environment International, you can check it here. We found some evidence of an increased COVID-19 mortality for long term exposure to NO\(_2\) (0.5% 95% CrI: -0.2% to 1.2%), whereas for PM\(_{2.5}\) the results are more uncertain (1.4% 95% CrI: -2.1% to 5.1%).

      <description>I have been invited to give a talk at the TIES 2020 virtual conference. My talk will be about the use of Bayesian spatial hierarchical models and downscaling. I will use the proposed scheme to quantify the long-term effect of air-pollution on COVID-19 mortality. My talk will be on the 2nd of December at 10.50am UK time. For more information about the program see here.</description>
