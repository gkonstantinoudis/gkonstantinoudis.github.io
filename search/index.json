I used a spatial varying coefficient to identify spatial vulnerabilities of COPD hospitalisation and used factors such as deprivation, urbanicity, mean ambient temperature and green space to explain the observed spatial vulnerabilities. I also calculated the population attributable function and assuming a causal effect, 6 280 (95% CrI 3 441 to 8 993) COPD hospitalisations were attributable to heat exposure.\n Regional excess mortality during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic Focusing on 5 European countries, Enlgand, Greece, Italy, Spain and Switzerland, we calculated the excess mortality during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic at the subnational level. With around 30%, Madrid, Castile-La Mancha, Castile-Leon (Spain) and Lombardia (Italy) were the regions with the highest excess mortality. In England, Greece and Switzerland, the regions most affected were Outer London and the West Midlands (England), Eastern, Western and Central Macedonia (Greece), and Ticino (Switzerland), with 15-20% excess mortality in 2020.\n COVID-19 and air-pollution In this research, I am developing spatial Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the effect of long term exposure to air-pollution, namely NO\\(_2\\) and PM\\(_{2.5}\\) on COVID-19 mortality. The first analysis showed that for every 1\\(\\mu g/m^3\\) increase in the long term averaged NO\\(_2\\) exposure the COVID-19 mortality increases by 0.5% (95% credible interval: -0.2%, 1.2%), whereas the results for PM\\(_{2.5}\\) are more uncertain 1.4% (-2.1%, 5.1%). Currently we are working on including known comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes and examine the mediation effect.\n Evaluating the burden of climate-related respiratory disease using high resolution spatiotemporal models In this research, I will develop a framework of analysis using spatiotemporal models to evaluate climate-related disease burden. The methodology of this project builds on Bayesian spatiotemporal models for risk assessment and quantification of associated economic costs, hence model and parameter uncertainty will be naturally propagated across the proposed framework. I will use this approach to estimate the temperature-related respiratory health burden in the UK and communicate results to stakeholders and public health experts to implement relevant public health strategies. This is an interdisciplenariy project with several national and international collaborations including Prof Blangiardo (main supervisor), Prof Baio and Dr Mineli (co-supervisors) but also with Dr Gasparrini, Prof Schuhmacher, Dr Bhatt, Dr Ballester and Dr Vicedo-Cabrera.\n\n Analysis of spatial clustering of childhood cancers My thesis was entitled “Analysis of spatial clustering of childhood cancers” and it was the first systematic investigation of the spatial clustering of childhood cancers in Switzerland. The first part of my PhD was focused on global clustering and cluster detection, whereas the second part on disease mapping and spatial regression. During the second part of my PhD I gained expertise on models commonly used in spatial epidemiology, like log-Gaussian Cox processes and the Besag-York-Mollie model.\n Grants  Evaluating the burden of climate-related respiratory disease using high resolution spatiotemporal models (2019-2021)\n Residential and occupational exposure to ultraviolet radiation and hematological malignancies (2019-2020)\n Low dose ionising radiation and childhood cancer (2018-2021)\n   ","href":"/research/","title":"Research"},{"content":"I have written the following R-package:\nGeoSwiss Tools for geocoding address in Switzerland. The package takes addresses as strings and uses two different data bases, google maps and Swiss topo (Swiss Federal Office of Topography) Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s national mapping agency and return the corresponding geocodes.

In this tutorial I use the famours Scottish lip cancer dataset and provide 4 different approaches for disease mapping. I start with a basic global smoothing by incorporating unstructured random effect, then I show how to fit an ICAR, I continue showwing a BYM model and finally I show how to fit the BYM2 in NIMBLE. The results of the Scottish lip cancer data are then compared and discussed.\nSpatial ecological regression with NIMBLE.  This tutorial is motivated by an analysis I conducted to examine the effect of long-term exposure to air-pollution on COVID-19 mortality. The purpose of this tutorial is to show how to use NIMBLE to perform ecological regression and also interpret the results. I am using the BYM2 prior to capture spatial autocorrelation.\nLeroux model in NIMBLE and CARBayes.  This tutorial compares the Leroux model using CARBayes and NIMBLE. It uses the Scottish lip cancer as a case study, shows the code for both approaches and makes relevant comparison for the random fields and hyperparameters across the different softwares.\nSplines and random walk processes in NIMBLE.  In this tutorial, I am showing how to fit splines and random walk processes using NIMBLE. In particular, it shows code for cubic splines and random walks of order 1 and 2. The case example is the Chicago dataset to assess the effect of temperature on all cause mortality in Chicago, as used in the vignette of dlnm by Gasparrini.\nSpacetime interaction type I.  In this tutorial, I am showing how to fit inseparable spacetime models. I am modeling cervical cancers among HIV positive women in South Africa, as analysed here. I am considering spacetime interaction type I as introduced by Held.\nImputing missing values.  In this tutorial, I am showing how to perform imputation in the Bayesian framework. The case example is the Chicago dataset that was also used on the 4th tutorial and I am modeling the effect of temperature on all cause mortality, while adjusting and imputing for PM$_{10}$.\nPieswise linear model.  In this tutorial, I am showing how to fit piecewise linear models in NIMBLE. The threshold is selected in two ways, either by minimizing the WAIC or by adding a random variable for the threshold. I apply the methodology to the Chicago dataset.\nINLA tutorials All the code and datasets used for the tutorial can be also found here.\n Disease mapping with BYM2 in INLA.  In this tutorial I use lung cancer mortality in England and I show how to use INLA to perform disease mapping. I fit two different models: the first is with an unstrucutred random effect, whereas the second with the BYM2 prior. I use PC priors as the selected priors and show how to postprocess the INLA output.\nEcological regression with BYM2 in INLA.  In this tutorial I use data on stroke mortality in Shefield together with information about air-pollution levels, and deprivation. I show how to perform ecological regression with INLA and BYM2 and interpret the results accordingly.\nLog-Gaussian Cox processes in INLA.  In this tutorial I used simulated data to mimic the type 1 diabetes incidence in the canton of Zurich in Switzerland. The nature of the data is point process data, so I choose to fit a log-Gaussian Cox process with R-INLA. I select the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to approximate the continuous spatial field.\nNote: All the above analysis are subject of corrections and improvements.
