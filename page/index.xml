      <description>I am an MRC Skills Development Research Fellow at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, part of the MRC Centre for Environment and Health at Imperial College London. My group is the Environmental and Health Statistics group headed by Prof Marta Blangiardo.
Prior to that, I did my PhD in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) at the University of Bern in Switzerland in the Environmental and Spatial Epidemiology group headed by Dr Ben Spycher.</description>

      <description>COPD and heat exposure In this research, I developed Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of heat exposure to COPD hospitalisation during 2007-2018 in England. I used a spatial varying coefficient to identify spatial vulnerabilities of COPD hospitalisation and used factors such as deprivation, urbanicity, mean ambient temperature and green space to explain the observed spatial vulnerabilities. I also calculated the population attributable function and assuming a causal effect, 6 280 (95% CrI 3 441 to 8 993) COPD hospitalisations were attributable to heat exposure.</description>

      <description>I have written the following R-package:
GeoSwiss Tools for geocoding address in Switzerland. The package takes addresses as strings and uses two different data bases, google maps and Swiss topo (Swiss Federal Office of Topography) Switzerland&amp;rsquo;s national mapping agency and return the corresponding geocodes. The geocodes are directly transformed into the Swiss grid for coordinates and also come with a precision metric that gives a qualitative assessment of the precision of the geocode.</description>

      <description>NIMBLE tutorials All the code and datasets used for the tutorial can be also found here.
 Conditional Autoregressive models with NIMBLE.  In this tutorial I use the famours Scottish lip cancer dataset and provide 4 different approaches for disease mapping. I start with a basic global smoothing by incorporating unstructured random effect, then I show how to fit an ICAR, I continue showwing a BYM model and finally I show how to fit the BYM2 in NIMBLE.</description>
