I have just uploaded two more NIMBLE tutorials showing how to fit the Leroux model and how to code cubic splines and random walks of order 1 and 2 in NIMBLE. The tutorial are in the teaching tab under the names [Leroux model in NIMBLE and CARBayes](/nimble/RmarkLeroux.html)  and [Splines and random walk processes in NIMBLE](/nimble/splines.html). The are more to come.
