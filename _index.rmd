I am an MRC Skills Development Research Fellow at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, part of the [MRC Centre for Environment and Health](https://www.environment-health.ac.uk/) at Imperial College London. My group is the [Environmental and Health Statistics group](https://sites.google.com/view/envstats/home) headed by [Prof Marta Blangiardo](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.blangiardo). 

Before that, Î™ did my PhD in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/) (ISPM) at the University of Bern in Switzerland in the [Environmental and Spatial Epidemiology group](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/research/research_groups/environmental_and_spatial_epidemiology/index_eng.html) headed by [Dr Ben Spycher](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/spycher_ben/index_eng.html). Also, I obtained an MSc in Biostatistics at the University of Glasgow and BSc in Mathematics at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 


My current domain of research is on Bayesian spatiotemporal models using exact point data. I combine the aforementioned modelling framework with health economics to investigate the climate related respiratory disease burden in the England. This project is a collaboration with [Prof Gianluca Baio](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/) at UCL, [Dr Cosetta Minelli](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/cosetta.minelli1) at Imperial College, [Dr Antonio Gasparrini](http://www.ag-myresearch.com/) at LSHTP, [Dr Ana Vicedo-Cabrera](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/vicedo_cabrera_ana_maria/index_eng.html) at ISPM University of Bern, [Prof Dominic Schuhmacher](http://www.dominic.schuhmacher.name/) at University of Gottingen, [Dr Samir Bhatt](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.bhatt) at Imperial College and [Dr Joan Ballester](http://www.joanballester.eu/contact.html) at ISGlobal.
