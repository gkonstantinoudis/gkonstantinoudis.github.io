<p>Our recent study in assessing the effect of long term exposure to airpollution on COVID-19 morality have just been published in Environment International, you can check it <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020322716">here</a>. We found some evidence of an increased COVID-19 mortality for long term exposure to NO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> (0.5% 95% CrI: -0.2% to 1.2%), whereas for PM<span class="math inline">\(_{2.5}\)</span> the results are more uncertain (1.4% 95% CrI: -2.1% to 5.1%).</p>
